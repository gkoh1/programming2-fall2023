                        Emmy Noether was a German mathematician who made crucial contributions to a variety of fields, including mathematical physics and abstract algebra.
                    One of her major contributions was study of rings, an important algebraic structure. 
                    Some examples are matrices, the integers, the rational numbers, or the integers mod m under the usual addition and multiplication operations.
                    As a result of her work, she is often known as the mother of modern algebra.
                    In addition, she made a fundamental contribution to physics through Noether's theorem which connects the algebraic idea of symmetry to conservations of certain quantities.

                        Despite her capabilities, her identity as a Jewish woman meant that she struggled to access many of the resources offered to her contemporaries.
                        While other top-level mathematicians of her time such as David Hilbert and Felix Klein recognized her contributions, she was barred from lecturing at their university, the University of Gottingen, at time one of the top mathematical research institutions in the world, on the basis of objections from professors in other departments.
                        As a result, she lectured under Hilbert's name for several years until after the end of World War 1, at which point some of the traditional chauvinistic attitudes in German society lessened.
                        Later, she was forced to flee Germany when the Nazis came to power and removed Jews from public positions.
                        She spent the last years of her life teaching at Bryn Mawr College in the US.
