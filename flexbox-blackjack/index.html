            Welcome to Grant's Casino! With our notriously petulant dealers and sketchy UI choices, we're sure that once you start playing, you'll never want to stop!
        </p>
        <p>
            So, you want to play Blackjack, huh? Well, in case you need a reminder, here are the rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> You start with two cards, hit draws another card</li>
            <li> The dealer starts with two cards, one face down.</li>
            <li> Once you stand, the dealer hits until their score is at least 17</li>
            <li> Highest score under 22 wins. Dealer wins ties unless both players get 21, in which case it is a tie.</li>
            <li> If you go over 21 (bust), you lose and the dealer doesn't play.</li>
            <li> After the game is over, click reset to play again (you have no other choice . . .)</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
