    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Quesadillas are a simple-to-make food that is great for lunch or dinner.
        These quesadillas only have cheese, but adding a meat or beans to the quesadilla can make it a complete meal.
        Sour cream, salsa, or guacamole can be good options to dip your quesadilla, and you can serve it with tortilla chips if you want.
        A quesadilla or two could also serve as a substantial side dish if you are serving many people.
        These quesadillas are best eaten fresh though, so don't let them sit around too long.
        It is natural to cook two at a time, as they can sit back to back in the pan.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A tortilla (I reccomend a flour-corn tortilla, but you may have a different preference)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Mexican blend of cheese</li>
        <li>Canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a healthy ammount of cheese in the tortilla and fold the tortilla. </li>
        <li>Gently apply oil to the exposed side of the tortilla. It is easiest to do this with a brush, but a paper towel will work.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt onto the tortilla - the amount you sprinkle will depend on how salty you want the quesadilla to be.</li>
        <li>Turn the stove on to medium. Put the tortilla oil-side-down in a pan and put the pan on the stove.</li>
        <li>Periodically check to see how well-cooked the oiled side of the tortilla is. Once it is golden brown, turn off the stove and oil and salt the other side of the tortilla.</li>
        <li>Flip the quesadilla over, and cook until the other side is also golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let the quesadilla sit for a couple of minutes, then cut it into four triangles.</li>
    </ol>
