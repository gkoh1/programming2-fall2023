    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> 
        Salmon is both a tasty and healthy fish. To make it even tastier (if less healthy), add a maple glaze.
        This is a simple recipe, although remember to budget some time for mariniation in order to get the best flavor.
        Many vegetables from aspargus to broccoli complement the salmon well, as does some rice or quinoa.
        Choose your favorite sides, and make them while the salmon marinates!
