        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Almost 100 years ago, the Moretti family came to the United States from the region of Apulia in Southern Italy.
            Since then, we have been hard at work delivering delicious and authentic Italian food to the residents of Lincoln Park.
            While our menu has changed over the years, our commitment to stellar service and high quality ingredients has not.
            Every day, our chef, Giuseppe Moretti, creates different special dishes made with locally sourced, in-season ingredients. 
            Come to Moretti's to get a slice of Italian cooking - our family to yours.
