    <h1>Gustav Mahler</h1>
    <p>
        Gustav Mahler was an Austrian composer, primarily known for his symphonic work. Born to a Jewish family, he converted to Catholicism in order to obtain a post conducting the Vienna Opera. 
        His music involves themes of heroism, death, and ressurection, and is notable for its scale, both in length and number of instruments. His eigth symphony is often known as the <strong>Symphony of 1000</strong> due to the number of instruments and vocalists needed to perform it.
        Mahler was superstitious, and believed that the ninth symphony was unlucky, given Beethoven only wrote nine and few other composers passed that number since his death. He thus wrote <em>Das Lied Von Der Erde</em>, a symphonic song cycle, rather than another symphony, although he eventually wrote a ninth, his last.
