            Rules of Blackjack:
        <ul>
            <li> You start with two cards. Hit draws another card</li>
            <li> A card's value is equal to the number on it. Face cards are worth ten, and aces are worth 11 or 1 (whatever is more beneificial). Your total is the sum of the values of all your cards.</li>
            <li> If your hand has exactly two cards with the same value (i.e. 2 queens and nothing else), you may split. Splitting creates a new hand (with the same wager) using one of the cards. Your original hand and the new hand will each draw a card, ending with two total.</li>
            <li> If your hand has exactly two cards, you may double down, which doubles your wager, draws one card, and then stands.</li>
            <li> The dealer starts with two cards, one face down.</li>
            <li> Once you stand, the dealer hits until their score is at least 17</li>
            <li> Highest score under 22 wins. Dealer usually wins ties.</li>
            <li> If your cards in a 2-card hand make a blackjack (total of 21), that's a natural blackjack and wins unless the dealer also has a natural blackjack, in which case it ties.</li>
            <li> If a hand gets a (not natural) blakjack and the dealer gets blackjack, the hand ties. </li>
            <li> If a hand goes over 21 (bust), is loses. If all hands bust, the dealer doesn't play.</li>
            <li> After the game is over, click reset to play again </li>
        </ul>
